Gregory Perelman - For those who haven't heard of him,almost everyone of you except for those few who might've stumbled onto his works in the field of math, is ,as you might've guessed already, a contemporary mathematician of our present world who dedicated most of his conscious life working on unsolved math mysteries-conjectures to be precise.One that gained him popularity is Poincare conjecture,which remained unproven until this guy came up with a proof for that conjecture and marveled many other mathematicians who spent most of their time working on it.That's nothing at all amusing ,since in the world of math it's quite common for such things to happen.What's more fascinating about him is what happened later.
In 2006,He was awarded The Field's medal and later in 2010,Millennium prize along which comes an impressive  1 million cash prize, both of which he simply rejected without any further thought.Well,now, this made it more convincing for the rest of the world who watched it happen to pin it down for yet another proof of how crazy mathematicians can be. In a field where the funding is so scarce,1 million is everything one might wish for ,be it for research or bebop.Nonetheless,Perelman rejected both for reasons unknown.One might say that he either considered math to be a form of art,a guideline to understand this universe of ours or perhaps another fully loaded M-nerd who know not what the world runs upon.
But the truth seems to be far from what I imagined it to be.Quite after he rejected the millennium prize,Gregori ,having felt that he was oppressed by his fellow mathematicians when they downplayed his part in the proof of some other conjecture,quit working on math for the rest of his life."Math has become too painful a subject to me.Also,it seems that the world of mathematicians is full of conformists who care not what others have done in a respectful manner."
It's not the case with just math,but almost with every other scientific field known to us.Prominence seems to be quite  influential  among many other things that drive our present day humans.For quite some time in the past,I always thought it to be something that white collar guys are after regardless of ethical values concerning it.Science and many other subjects that are rationally considerable,shouldn't depend on the popularity or fame one gains based on the contribution made by them.This is not to say that people shouldn't be recognized for mind-blowing stuff they discover,which in the case of science are countless as everyone knows - they should and will be,but let it not be the driving force for demystifying the strange or discovering the unknown.Science,for all I know,should be done with nothing but a rational mind with a pure conscience driven by none other than curiosity.
